    question: "Why wouldn't I just hire a full-time designer?",
    answer: [
      "Good question! For starters, the annual cost of a full-time senior-level designer now exceeds $100,000, plus benefits (and good luck finding one available). Aside from that, you may not always have enough work to keep them busy at all times, so you're stuck paying for time you aren't able to utilize.",
      "With the monthly plan, you can pause and resume your subscription as often as you need to ensure you're only paying your designer when you have work available for them.",

    question: "How do I request designs?",
    answer: ["Designjoy offers a ton of flexibility in how you request designs using Trello. Some common ways clients request designs is directly via Trello, sharing Google docs or wireframes, or even recording a brief Loom video (for those who prefer not to write their briefs out). Basically, if it can be linked to or shared in Trello, it's fair game."],
